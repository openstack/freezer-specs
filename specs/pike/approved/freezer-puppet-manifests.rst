==========================================
Freezer puppet manifests spec
==========================================

https://blueprints.launchpad.net/freezer/+spec/freezer-puppet-manifests

Problem description
===================

As there is no any automation tools for Freezer it is proposed to develop a
set of puppet manifests for auto install the following Freezer components:

* Freezer (freezer-agent and scheduler);
* Freezer API;
* Freezer Horizon Web UI;

Optionally we can consider possible to add set of manifests for Freezer
Disaster Recovery.

Use Cases
---------

All implemented manifest should follow principles of idempotence.

This bundle should make Freezer deployment pretty convenient and simple for
end-users and shouldn't require additional pieces of knowledge regarding
Freezer infrastructure during the first installation.

Also, these manifests should significantly simplify maintenance of Freezer
modules.


Proposed change
===============

* All Freezer puppet manifest should be located in separate repo:
  https://github.com/openstack/puppet-freezer
* Puppet community requires having packages for various operating systems.
  Nevertheless, for a while can be used package puppet module

 * RPM packages should be discussed in #rdo IRC channel on OFTC and then
   added in RDO trunk according to the RDO `guaidliness <https://www.rdoproject.org/documentation/rdo-packaging/#how-to-add-a-new-package-to-rdo-trunk>`_
 * Debian packaging of OpenStack should be discussed in #openstack-pkg IRC
   channel on OFTC

* at the very beginning puppet manifests should be implemented for Freezer,
  Freezer-API and python-freezerclient components and only after that for
  Freezer-WebUI and Freezer-DR

Alternatives
------------

This functionality can be implemented in various ways like ansible playbooks,
shell scripts salt formulas, however, it was decided to start from puppet
manifests.
