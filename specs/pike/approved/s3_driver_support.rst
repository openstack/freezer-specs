=========================
S3 storage driver support
=========================

* https://blueprints.launchpad.net/freezer/+spec/s3-driver-support

Provide more storage media options for users to store the backup data.

Problem description
===================

Currently, freezer can only store backup data to swift compatible object
storage (except local and ssh), so we should increase support for other storage
driver. S3 compatible object storage is a valid choice, which is used by many
individuals and companies in the public or private clouds. With S3 driver,
freezer can store backup data in S3 compatible object storage, such as AWS S3
or ceph S3 interface.

Use Cases
---------

* Users that want to backup data to S3 compatible object storage.

* OpenStack distributions deployed without swift module.

Proposed change
===============

Implement in the freezer-agent a new storage type called 's3'.

With specifying the 's3' storage type, the authentication parameters and the
S3 endpoint, backup data will be stored on S3 compatible storage after the
backup finished.

Alternatives
------------

None
