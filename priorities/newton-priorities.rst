Hardening and testing
---------------------

In Newton, we want to increase as much as possible the test coverage for
Freezer.
This include better and more unit tests and tempest tests.

Agent refactoring
-----------------

In Newton, we want to make our freezer-agent pluggable for four of its core
internal parts:

* Pluggable storage: In order to support more storage backend
* Pluggable snapshot: In order to support more snapshoting technique (like xfs,
  brtfs, ...)
* Pluggable application: Through a system of hooks, we want to facilitate the
  support of new application aware backups.
* Pluggable engine: In order to support other ways of processing data.

Disaster recovery
-----------------

In Newton we will kick off freezer-dr in order to provide tooling to support
disaster recovery cases where backup/restore is not able to provide a good enough RTO.

Documentation improvement
-------------------------

In Newton, we will refactor our documentation. This includes mooving it away
from the READMEs, refactoring and updating the content as well as improving the
developper documentation.
